# FinalProject-WebAppDev
 
 Option 1: 
Develop a ASP.NET MVC Core website using the IDE of your choice, using Git as a code
repository. I recommend Azure Repos as they have unlimited free repositories.
The website should document your one of your favorite hobbies. Examples of hobbies could
include:
- A sport
- A sports team
- Games (card, video)
- Computers
- Reading
- Cooking
- Hiking
- Movies
- Etc.
 
Your website can be as large or small as you would like but should include the at
least the following criteria:
- [X] Menu of some sort to navigate the website
- [X] 6+ pages (Home page + 5 other pages. About the hobby, about yourself, etc.)
- [ ] 2+ controllers
- [X] A page about yourself
- [ ] A database to hold information about your hobby. The database should simply
contain a connection string to your local version of SQL Server. ((LocalDB)\.)
- [ ] A page to display the database info (Possibly in an html table?)
- [X] View folders per controllers
- [X] Shared folder with _Layout.cshtml
- [X] _Viewstart.cshtml
- [X] _ViewImports.cshtml
- [X] Migrations folder to create the DB artifacts
- [X] wwwroot folder with jquery, bootstrap, css, etc.
- [X] Connection string in appsettings.json and DBContext using I.o.C. (D.I.) into
controllers after being registered in Startup.cs
